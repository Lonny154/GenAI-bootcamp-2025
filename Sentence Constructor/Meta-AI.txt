Student Input: What do you want for dinner tonight? 


¡Hola! (Hello!)
The translation of "What do you want for dinner tonight?" in Spanish is:
"¿Qué quieres para cenar esta noche?"
Let me break it down for you:
"What" = "¿Qué?"
"do you want" = "quieres"
"for dinner" = "para cenar"
"tonight" = "esta noche"
¡Espero que esto te ayude! (I hope this helps!)
