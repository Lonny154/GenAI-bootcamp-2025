Student Input: What do you want for dinner tonight? 

Great! Letâ€™s work through this together.

First, letâ€™s break the sentence down step by step.

"What do you want" â†’ The verb "want" in Spanish is querer. How would you conjugate querer for "you" (informal)?

"for dinner" â†’ The word for "dinner" in Spanish is cena.

"tonight" â†’ The word for "tonight" in Spanish is esta noche.

Try putting the pieces together!

Hereâ€™s a vocabulary table to help:

English	Spanish
want	querer
dinner	cena
tonight	esta noche
Give it a shot and let me know what you come up with! ðŸ˜Š






You said:
que quieres para cena esta noche
ChatGPT said:
You're really close! Just one small tweakâ€”when talking about meals in Spanish, we usually say "la cena" instead of just "cena."

So, the correct sentence would be:

Â¿QuÃ© quieres para la cena esta noche?

Great job! Let me know if you want to try another one. ðŸ˜Š
