I have been prompting Claude and Chapt GPT and Meta ai
I have had the most success with Claude so far. ON 02/05 chat gpt seems to be having server issues, I am unable to login. I also had issues with claude 02/04. Have not had any technical difficulties with Meta AI.
I also tried using copilot Ai locally on my machine. It did not do anything it just sat and spun for five minutes. 

The reason i liked Claude was that it gave me some actualy code to use when creating the Ai assistant. I am unfamiliar with this world so i do not know if it was good code or not. I am also very new to github. 

Chat gpt i attempted to use tree of thought prompting. I just declared to use tree of thought before prompting and it worked ok. I wonder if i can just put in the prompts here?
